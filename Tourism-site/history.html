                <h2>Brief History of Cadawinonan</h2>
                <p>During the period of our history when people were yet moving from place to place, many of those from the neighboring town of Dauin found the present barrio of Cadawinonan good place. Very soon enough, a population to constitute a barrio had settled in the place. The big majority of them were from the town of Dauin and they were called “dawinonans”. Hence, in the town of Dauin they were called Dawinonan, in this barrio they were called “Cadawinoan”. The name was adopted and is now the official name of the barangay.</p>
